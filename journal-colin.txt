2/5/16:
	This week I studied what we can do with Heroku, and
	whether it's going to be suitable for our project.
	So far, it appears that it will work, since it has
	support for plenty of technologies, including
	Node.js, websockets, and PostgreSQL, which we'll
	probably be using.  I wrote a rough protocol
	specification outlining generally what we're going
	to do for client-server-communication.  I also put
	together the initial server implementation, with a
	very bare-bones web server and a slightly more
	useful WebSocket server.  It's no game yet, but
	we're getting there.  As far as I can tell, Heroku
	only works with HTTP traffic, which is why the
	server is using WebSockets instead of normal
	sockets.  It's likely that we'll need a web server
	anyway though, so I think it's a good idea.  I also
	set up a PostgreSQL server on Heroku and my laptop.
	I studied migrate-db and it looks quite useful.
