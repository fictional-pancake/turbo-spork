# Proposal: Turbo-Spork
## A simple RTS game of galactic domination
Colin Reeder & Tony Brar

## Needs and Opportunities
Games exist like this, but they're not good enough. Most similar RTS games (of low enough complexity
that they could be played in a browser) are too simple to be enjoyable for long, and most importantly
they don't have multiplayer. 

## Audience / Clients / Users
Anyone who wants to play an RTS game. I'm sure we can find some from the computer science class,
our families, and r/playtesting.

## Product
A match of the game will start with two or more players spawning with several nodes under their control.
Each node periodically spawns units that can be sent in groups to other nodes. The goal is to capture 
all the nodes on the map by sending attacking forces to enemy-controlled nodes and defeating them.
The game should be complicated enough to actually be fun but not so complicated as to have a steep learning
curve. Different nodes will probably have unique properties such as deploying units faster. We may add
the ability for players to cast spells with cooldowns to impact the game, such as teleporting a group of
units to a node.

## Timeline
| Date          | Deliverable    |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| February 26   |    A server    |
| April 1       |    A client    |
| April 29      |Polish (mobile?)|

## Reality Check
The only issue would be hosting the server. We found a service called Heroku that would allow us to host
the Java server for free (with some limitations), which we will probably use.

## Conclusion
The fairly simple rules will hopefully breed a variety of strategies which will set this game apart from
others like it. I think the format of several short matches will also be ideal. Turbo-Spork will be a
fun, fast-paced game of skill.
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING!!!
